Hi there!  Thanks for visiting.  My name is Vincent.

I'm a software engineer with experience across the stack.
My experience with JavaScript and the React framework has enabled me to build dynamic frontend user interfaces.
I've also worked in service-oriented architectures using Node.js/Express and databases including: PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

### Beyond the tech...

I'm a theatre artist!  I've enjoyed doing lighting designs for dance concerts, and sound designs for stage plays.
Live performances are very special, and I could discuss their creators' artistry and vision, and the ideas they want to convey forever.

### Contact me

Feel free to reach out to me.  We can chat about server optimization, designing the sleekest UI, or popular culture.
If I'm unable to help you for one reason or another, I would love to connect you with someone can.
